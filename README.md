# Joyce Christmas Lights: The Upside Down Edition!

Ever wanted your Christmas lights to communicate with the Upside Down, just like Joyce Byers? Well, now they can (sort of)! This project brings the eerie, yet heartwarming, magic of "Stranger Things" to your holiday decorations, making your lights smarter than your average string of bulbs and potentially a portal to another dimension.

## Get the Party Started (Before the Gate Opens)!

1.  **Clone this mysterious repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd joyce-christmas-lights
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary equipment (dependencies):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Light it up! (Run the dev server):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Then, prepare to be amazed as your lights (virtually, for now) enter the world of Hawkins, Indiana!

## Usage

Imagine controlling your lights to spell out messages, perhaps even communicating with those trapped in the Upside Down. This application provides the interface to create dynamic light patterns, potentially reacting to audio cues or user input, much like Joyce's iconic communication wall. Explore the possibilities of a truly *strange* Christmas light display!

## Warning:

May cause excessive nostalgia for the 80s, a sudden craving for Eggo waffles, and an irrational fear of flickering lights. Side effects include wanting to decorate everything with smart lights and checking your walls for interdimensional breaches.
